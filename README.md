A GTA San Andreas launcher mainly created to be used with a Steam version, so that playing multiplayer mods still count hours on Steam.

## Instalation
1. Rename main executable from `gta-sa.exe` to `gta_sa.exe`.
2. [Download launcher from the releases page](https://github.com/D00NIK/GTASALauncher/releases), put it in the game folder and rename it to `gta-sa.exe`.
3. Done, now launcher should run when you launch GTA from Steam.

## A few things
* Corresponding executables must be in folders below:
```
GTA_PATH = "gta_sa.exe";
MTA_PATH = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MTA San Andreas 1.6\\Multi Theft Auto.exe";
SAMP_PATH = "samp.exe";
```

* SAMP probably works, didn't test it fully
